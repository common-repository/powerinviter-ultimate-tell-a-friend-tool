PowerInviter - Ultimate "Tell a friend" Tool

== Description ==

Regular "Tell a friend" scripts can only send simple recommendations to people. 
PowerInviter represents a new generation of "Tell a friend" programs with many additional "PRO" features 
and viral marketing principles: an extremely easy way to convey a message and get a reward for the action.

Without interesting rewards, only a few visitors will feel the urge to tell their friends about your site, 
so PowerInviter creates motivation: people will get gifts for their recommendations! 
It is precisely this fact that explains the MULTIPLE EFFECTIVENESS of PowerInviter 
as compared with other "Tell a friend" solutions.

This plugin allows people to recommend any page (post) to their friends with the title and short page description (teaser). 
It is fully integrated with the http://www.powerinviter.com online service, 
so you do not need to place any html code into your PHP templates.

The average effectiveness of the recommendations emails is up to 60%;
such a result is impossible using any other kind of advertising!
Sending of recommendations and bonus emails are fully automated, so you really have nothing else to do!
